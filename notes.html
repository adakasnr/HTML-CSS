<!DOCTYPE html>   //html version
<html lang="en">  // root element

    <h1>waste fellow</h1>   //heading
    <p>i am a phani man</p> //paragraph
</body>
</html>

-->(<html></html>)
all the coding or data what we are writing should be in html tag, including body and heading
-->(<head></head>)
info about the page in one word or small sentecnce
-->(<body></body>)
all the matter that we need to display on the page should be in the body tags 
eg:-Heading(<h1></h1>)
heading should be in the body, it is related to the heaeding of the paragraph
eg:-Paragraph(<p></p>)
paragraph should be in the body,

word wrap
when there is longer text line it goes on the same line when we are typing, we can not see untill we scrole side
for this issue we have to turn on word wrap in the settings

emmet abbrivations- it saves our time while coding, when we  type single alphabate of that tag then emmet will suggest the related tags(complete end to end tag)

heading element
6 types based on size
<h1></h1>  // biggest
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h6></h6>  // smallest

<sup></sup> -->
<sub></sub> -->

paragraph element 
<p></p>
Whatever we write here will be considerd as paragraph 
note point-
 html is a white space collapse which means it ignores extra spaces, if we enter many spaces b/w words it will consider only single space 
if we want to keep more space in b/w words we need use special elements 

--adding image to html 
 to add image we need to download that image to our system

<img src="./webDevelopment.jpg" alt="">


src-source of image, 
we need to enter slash to select the image 
alt-if image unable to load, Whatever we mentioin in alt will be displayed

image&video size- height&width will be given in pixles
1 pixle=0.2645mm
10 pixles=2.645mm
100 pixles=26.45833mm

if we want another image under the same heading, create new image tag under the same heading. the image will come side by side
if we need new down to that create new heading and put new image tag under that heading

always create a separate folder for images
if we create a folder for images, we should give correctr path to acess the image

syntax for commenting in html (<!--comment-->)

tag to provide links in the page 
(<a href="link">info about the link</a>)
when we click on the link it will open link page on the same tab it self but when we want to keep the current tab as it is and open new tab for that link we need to use target keyword
target-it specifiesd where to display the URL(Uniform Resource Locator. URL also known as internet address or web address)
it will give options like self,blank,parent and top
self- link will get open on the same tab itself, this is gone be default if we do not mention any target 
blank- link will open new tab

to go back to the top of the page
when we are at bottom of the page, to reach top of the page we can create a single click which will take to top 
for that by using link option with (#top)

after creating link, inside the content we have to keep the image 

to make text in bold letters use (strong) element
to make text in italic letters use (em) element

if we use (li) in ol, number will come in front of item

tr-ROw of the cell
td-Data of the cell

to create form type for taking info from user
