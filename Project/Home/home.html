                        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web)
                        or an intranet (a private network).Web development can range from developing a simple single
                        static
                        page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network
                        services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may
                        include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
                        client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                        network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
                        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
                        building Websites: writing markup and coding.Web development may use content management systems
                        (CMS) to
                        make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
                        For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of
                        people(Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web
                        sites.
                        Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
                        assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems
                        technician. Web development maybe a collaborative effort between departments rather than the
                        domain of a designated department.
                        There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer,
                        and full-stack developer.Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run
                        in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.Since the commercialization
                        of the Web,the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.
